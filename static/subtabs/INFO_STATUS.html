    <!-- 1️⃣ System Status -->
    <div class="info-tab-block">
        <h2>System Status</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard is currently fully operational.<br>
            All data feeds, charts, explorer sections, and metric views
            are running reliably and without known issues.
            No problems have been detected so far.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 2️⃣ Release Status -->
    <div class="info-tab-block">
        <h2>Release Status</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard is currently in its initial release phase.
            All core features, data feeds, and visualizations
            are stably implemented and ready for productive use.<br>
            Additional features, refinements, and optimizations
            will be introduced gradually in future updates.
            <br><br>
            Responsive support for mobile devices and tablets
            is still in an early stage of development. <br>
            Basic readability and usability are provided,
            but certain layouts and tables are still being
            unified and optimized.
            <br><br>
            For the best overall overview and user experience,
            it is currently recommended to use the dashboard
            primarily in desktop view.

    <!-- 3️⃣ Planned Features -->
    <div class="info-tab-block">
        <h2>Planned Features</h2>
        <p>
            The Indicators section is still under active development.
            At this time, no specific release date can be provided
            for the first finalized indicator.<br>
            During the initial development phase, the primary focus
            has been on ensuring that existing tabs and core features
            are fully functional, performant, and stable
            before expanding into additional areas.
            <br><br>
            Some visualizations — particularly in the Network,
            Nodes, and Miner sections — are currently simplified
            by design and serve primarily for high-level
            conceptual orientation.<br>
            Further technical depth and extended detail
            will be added incrementally.
            <br><br>
            In addition, a significant expansion of existing
            chart visualizations and their underlying
            historical data sets is planned.<br>
            Specific scope, content, and timelines
            cannot yet be defined at this stage.
        </p>

    <!-- 4️⃣ Planned System Updates -->
    <div class="info-tab-block">
        <h2>Planned System Updates</h2>
        <p>
            System updates, technical optimizations, and structural
            adjustments are generally performed outside of peak usage hours.<br>
            Timing is chosen to minimize any potential impact
            on ongoing traffic and usage.
            <br><br>
            The goal is to apply all updates during live operation.
            Only in exceptional cases may it become necessary
            to temporarily restrict certain features
            or take the dashboard offline for a short period.<br>
            Scheduled system updates will be announced
            at least 24 hours in advance within the status section.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Next Planned Actions</h3>
        <p>
            The next update window is currently in planning.
            Further information will be published in due time
            within the status section.
        </p>

    <!-- 5️⃣ Personal Note -->
    <div class="info-tab-block">
        <h2>Personal Note</h2>
        <p>
            This dashboard is developed as an independent project
            outside of a fixed corporate or institutional context.<br>
            If you are interested in custom-developed, tailored
            web solutions for businesses or individual projects,
            feel free to get in touch at any time.<br>
            I am happy to review inquiries without obligation
            and assess whether and how an implementation
            could be meaningfully realized.
