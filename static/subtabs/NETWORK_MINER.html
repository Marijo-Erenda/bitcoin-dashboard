        <p class="NETWORK_MINER-legend">
            The displayed percentages are based on the share of Bitcoin blocks
            found by the respective mining pools within the last 24 hours.<br>
            This so-called <strong>block share</strong> is a commonly used statistical proxy
            for a pool’s relative share of the network hashrate.
        </p>

        <p class="NETWORK_MINER-legend">
            Since mining is a probabilistic process, short-term fluctuations can occur.
            Over longer time periods, however, the block share converges toward the
            actual hashrate distribution within the network.
            The sum of the displayed percentages usually does not equal exactly 100%,
            as only the largest mining pools are shown here, while smaller pools
            and solo miners are not listed individually.
            Rounding effects and temporal variations can also lead to minor deviations.
