    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="subtab-section">
        <p>
            Bitcoin mining pools play a central role in securing the Bitcoin network.
            They coordinate the hashing power of many individual miners in order to
            find new blocks more efficiently and reduce payout variance.
            Instead of mining alone, participants contribute their computational power
            to a shared pool and receive rewards proportional to their contribution.

            The distribution of mined blocks across pools provides important insights
            into the current structure of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.
            While no mining pool directly controls the network, the relative block share
            of large pools is often used as an indicator for decentralization,
            hashrate concentration, and potential systemic risks.

            It is important to note that mining pools do not usually own the hashrate
            themselves. The actual hashing power belongs to individual miners, who can
            switch pools at any time.
            As a result, the mining landscape is highly dynamic and can change
            significantly within short timeframes.

            The percentages shown above represent the share of Bitcoin blocks
            mined by each pool over the last 24 hours.
            This metric is commonly referred to as <strong>block share</strong>
            and serves as a statistical proxy for a pool’s relative hashrate.

            Because mining is a probabilistic process, short-term fluctuations
            are expected and do not necessarily reflect structural changes.
            Over longer periods, block share tends to converge toward the
            actual distribution of hashrate across the network.

            The total percentage may not equal exactly 100%.
            Smaller mining pools and solo miners are typically grouped together
            or omitted from the list, and rounding effects can also introduce
            minor deviations.

        <h4>Mining pools, decentralization and network security</h4>

        <p>
            From a network security perspective, mining pool distribution is closely
            monitored by researchers and the Bitcoin community.
            A highly decentralized mining landscape reduces the risk of coordinated
            attacks, censorship, or manipulation of transaction ordering.

            Concerns often arise when individual pools approach large shares of the
            total network hashrate.
            However, since miners can freely leave a pool, market forces tend to
            counteract excessive concentration over time.
            Historical data shows that mining dominance frequently shifts between pools.

            For this reason, mining pool statistics should always be interpreted
            in context and over longer time horizons.
            Short-term snapshots provide valuable insights,
            but do not by themselves imply long-term centralization or control.
