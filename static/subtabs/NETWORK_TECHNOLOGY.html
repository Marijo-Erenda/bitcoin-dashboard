                        Bitcoin is built on the principle of decentralization, meaning there is no central authority that controls the entire network.
                        Instead, all transactions are verified and recorded by many independent computers known as nodes.
                        Each node downloads the blockchain, validates transactions, and ensures that all participants share the same state of data.
                        Nodes communicate with one another, exchange information, and collectively form the backbone of the network.
                        This structure ensures that no single party can manipulate or control the system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This architecture makes the Bitcoin network highly resilient.
                        Even if a large number of nodes fail or go offline, the system continues to operate,
                        as the remaining nodes maintain the blockchain.
                        Each node contributes to the correctness and consistency of the network.
                        This principle is often referred to as a “trustless system”:
                        participants do not need to trust a central authority,
                        but instead rely on the automatic rules of the protocol and its consensus mechanisms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Decentralization also plays a crucial role in governance.
                        Changes to the Bitcoin protocol must be accepted by a majority of nodes,
                        preventing any single group from unilaterally altering the rules.
                        This distributed decision-making process promotes transparency and long-term stability,
                        while still allowing the network to evolve through broadly accepted improvements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition, the large number of nodes enables continuous verification of transactions
                        and protects against fraud or double spending.
                        Miners and nodes work together: miners create new blocks,
                        which nodes then validate before adding them to the blockchain.
                        The result is a highly secure, robust, and self-regulating system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In summary, distributed nodes ensure that Bitcoin remains independent,
                        trustworthy, and resistant to manipulation.
                        They form the foundation of a digital monetary network
                        that operates without central banks or government control
                        while providing long-term security and stability.

                        The blockchain is the core component of Bitcoin and forms the foundation for all transactions within the network.
                        It can be understood as a continuously growing chain of blocks,
                        each containing a record of individual transactions.
                        In addition to transaction data, every block includes a timestamp
                        and the hash of the previous block, making the chain immutable.
                        The hash acts as a digital fingerprint,
                        ensuring that any modification to a block is immediately detectable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The blockchain is decentralized and not controlled by any central institution.
                        Instead, thousands of independent nodes around the world store a full copy of the blockchain.
                        When a new transaction is broadcast,
                        these nodes verify its validity according to predefined protocol rules.
                        Only after a new block is accepted by the majority of the network
                        is it permanently added to the blockchain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of the most important properties of the blockchain is immutability.
                        Once a block has been confirmed, it cannot be altered without being detected.
                        This creates trust even among participants who do not know each other
                        and do not rely on a central authority.
                        As a result, the blockchain is highly resistant to fraud and manipulation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The blockchain also provides transparency.
                        All transactions can be verified at any time
                        without revealing the private identities of the participants.
                        This pseudonymity protects user privacy
                        while still ensuring full traceability of all transactions.
                        Compared to traditional banks or centralized payment systems,
                        this represents a significant advantage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From a technical perspective, Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hash function
                        to cryptographically secure each block.
                        This function generates a unique hash from the block data
                        that is practically impossible to reverse or forge.
                        Combined with the chaining of blocks,
                        this ensures the integrity of the entire system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The blockchain is not merely a transaction database,
                        but also the foundation for further innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
                        Layer-2 solutions, wallet architectures,
                        and advanced payment mechanisms are all built upon this secure and transparent structure.
                        Anyone seeking to understand Bitcoin
                        should recognize the blockchain as the central backbone
                        upon which all functionality depends.

                    <p>
                        Proof of Work (PoW) is Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism
                        that ensures transactions are securely confirmed and added to the blockchain.
                        It is the process through which miners create new blocks
                        while simultaneously protecting the network against fraud and manipulation.
                        Without Proof of Work, it would be significantly easier
                        for attackers to alter the blockchain or perform double-spending attacks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In Proof of Work, miners solve complex cryptographic puzzles
                        that are computationally intensive to solve
                        but easy for the network to verify.
                        These puzzles involve finding a valid block hash
                        that meets specific criteria.
                        Miners test millions of possible combinations
                        until a solution is found.
                        This process is known as mining.
                        The first miner to find a valid solution
                        is allowed to add the block to the blockchain
                        and receives a reward in newly issued bitcoins,
                        known as the block reward.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A critical component of Proof of Work is difficulty adjustment.
                        Approximately every 2,016 blocks,
                        the Bitcoin protocol automatically adjusts the mining difficulty
                        to ensure that a new block is produced roughly every ten minutes on average.
                        If more miners join the network,
                        the difficulty increases to maintain a stable block interval.
                        This mechanism provides predictability and stability
                        regardless of fluctuations in total network hash power.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Proof of Work is fundamental to Bitcoin’s security.
                        An attacker would need to control more than 50% of the network’s total hash rate
                        to manipulate transactions,
                        a scenario known as a 51% attack.
                        Due to the immense computational power and associated costs required,
                        such an attack is considered economically infeasible in practice.
                        At the same time, PoW ensures that all participants
                        share a consistent view of the blockchain
                        and that invalid blocks are rejected.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In simple terms, Proof of Work functions as a verifiable proof of computation.
                        Miners must expend real-world energy and computational resources
                        to generate a valid block hash that satisfies network requirements.
                        This verifiable effort makes manipulation extremely costly,
                        secures the ordering of blocks,
                        and ensures that only valid blocks become part of the blockchain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In summary, Proof of Work is the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s security model.
                        It guarantees reliable transaction confirmation,
                        preserves the immutability of the blockchain,
                        and enables a decentralized and transparent system
                        without relying on central authorities.

                    <p>
                        Hashrate refers to the total computational power
                        dedicated to Proof of Work within the Bitcoin network.
                        It represents how many cryptographic hash calculations per second
                        are performed collectively by all miners
                        to find valid blocks and confirm transactions.
                        Hashrate is a key indicator of the network’s security and stability.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A high hashrate indicates that a significant amount of computational power
                        is actively securing the network.
                        This makes attempts to manipulate the blockchain
                        extremely costly and difficult,
                        as an attacker would need to control a large portion of this power.
                        As hashrate increases,
                        the network becomes more resistant to attacks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hashrate is primarily determined
                        by the number of active miners
                        and the hardware they use.
                        Modern mining operations rely on specialized ASIC devices
                        optimized exclusively for computing SHA-256 hashes,
                        offering far greater efficiency
                        than general-purpose computers or graphics cards.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To maintain a consistent block time of approximately ten minutes,
                        the Bitcoin protocol automatically adjusts mining difficulty.
                        When hashrate rises, difficulty increases,
                        making it computationally harder to find valid blocks.
                        When hashrate declines, difficulty is reduced accordingly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Difficulty is measured relative to a fixed reference point known as Difficulty 1,
                        which was defined at the launch of the network
                        based on the computational power available at that time.
                        Current difficulty levels express
                        how much harder mining has become compared to this original baseline.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In summary, hashrate reflects
                        the collective computational effort protecting the Bitcoin network,
                        while difficulty ensures that this effort
                        translates into a stable and predictable block production schedule.
                        Together, these mechanisms form a core element
                        of Bitcoin’s security and self-regulation.

                        The mempool (memory pool) is the temporary holding area
                        for unconfirmed transactions within the Bitcoin network.
                        Every valid transaction broadcast to the network
                        is first placed in the mempool of nodes
                        before being included in a block by miners.

                        Block space is technically limited.
                        A Bitcoin block can effectively include
                        approximately 1,000,000 virtual bytes (vB) of transaction data.
                        Because the number of pending transactions often exceeds available block space,
                        a natural competition for inclusion arises.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Miners typically prioritize transactions
                        based on the fee paid per virtual byte (sat/vB)
                        in order to use limited block space efficiently.
                        Transactions with higher fees are generally confirmed more quickly,
                        while lower-fee transactions may remain in the mempool longer
                        during periods of high network congestion.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The mempool is not a single centralized location,
                        but exists independently across many nodes.
                        Depending on node configuration,
                        relay policies, and current network conditions,
                        the exact contents of the mempool may vary slightly between nodes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When the number of unconfirmed transactions increases significantly,
                        the mempool visibly fills up.
                        During such periods, the fee market intensifies,
                        as users are willing to pay higher fees
                        to secure faster confirmation.
                        When congestion decreases,
                        the mempool clears and required fees decline accordingly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The mempool therefore represents the mechanism
                        through which supply and demand for block space become visible.
                        It explains why transaction fees fluctuate
                        and why the required fee
                        often exceeds the protocol’s minimum relay fee.

                        Layer 1 refers to Bitcoin’s main blockchain
                        and forms the technical foundation of the entire network.
                        At this level, transactions are processed and recorded in blocks.
                        Each block contains a list of transactions,
                        a timestamp, and the hash of the previous block.
                        Linking these blocks together creates the blockchain,
                        ensuring the integrity and immutability of all transactions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The base layer is designed to support decentralized consensus mechanisms.
                        In Bitcoin, this is achieved through Proof of Work,
                        where miners solve cryptographic puzzles to produce new blocks.
                        The resulting computational effort provides a high level of security
                        and makes manipulation extremely difficult.
                        All validation processes occur directly at the protocol level,
                        without reliance on centralized intermediaries.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A defining feature of this architecture is decentralization.
                        There is no central authority approving transactions.
                        Instead, thousands of nodes worldwide
                        independently verify transactions,
                        store copies of the blockchain,
                        and ensure a consistent shared state.
                        This design makes the network resilient
                        to outages and coordinated attacks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Layer 1 also serves as the foundation of trust and security
                        for the entire Bitcoin system.
                        Transactions originating from higher layers, such as Layer 2,
                        ultimately rely on Layer 1 for final settlement.
                        For this reason, it is often referred to as the settlement layer,
                        where transactions achieve irreversible finality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In simple terms, Layer 1 can be understood
                        as the “main highway” of the Bitcoin network.
                        Every transaction, regardless of size or purpose,
                        must be anchored here
                        before it is considered final.
                        Miners, nodes, and consensus mechanisms
                        work together to ensure security,
                        transparency, and immutability.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In summary, Layer 1 represents Bitcoin’s core infrastructure.
                        It ensures that transactions are permanently,
                        transparently, and securely recorded.
                        Without this base layer,
                        there would be no reliable foundation
                        for Layer-2 solutions, wallets, or higher-level applications.
                        Anyone seeking to understand Bitcoin
                        should view Layer 1 as the fundamental backbone of the system.

                        Layer 2 refers to extensions built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain
                        that aim to process transactions more efficiently
                        without modifying the base layer itself.
                        The primary goal is to increase speed and scalability,
                        while security and final settlement
                        remain anchored to the main blockchain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most well-known and technically clear example
                        of a true Layer-2 solution
                        is the Lightning Network.
                        It operates using payment channels
                        that are opened directly between participants.
                        Channel opening and closing occur on-chain,
                        while all intermediate transactions take place off-chain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This allows an unlimited number of transactions
                        to be executed almost instantly
                        and with very low fees,
                        without permanently storing each transaction on the blockchain.
                        Only the final channel balance
                        is recorded on-chain as a settled state.
                        Security is derived directly
                        from the rules of the base layer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In simplified terms,
                        this creates an additional transaction layer
                        that relieves congestion on the blockchain
                        without altering its security model.
                        The main chain continues to function
                        as the final settlement layer,
                        while frequent or small payments
                        are handled off-chain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is important to distinguish Layer-2 solutions
                        from so-called sidechains.
                        Sidechains operate in parallel to the Bitcoin blockchain
                        and maintain their own consensus
                        or trust assumptions.
                        Although they can interact with Bitcoin,
                        they are not considered true Layer-2 solutions,
                        as their security is not fully derived
                        from Bitcoin’s base layer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In summary, Layer 2 expands Bitcoin
                        with a scalable usage layer
                        without altering the properties of the base layer.
                        True Layer-2 solutions such as the Lightning Network
                        enable fast payments,
                        while the blockchain remains responsible
                        for security, scarcity, and final settlement.

                    <p>
                        The Bitcoin halving is a protocol-defined mechanism
                        that periodically reduces the block reward paid to miners by half.
                        Its purpose is to control the issuance of new bitcoins
                        and permanently enforce the maximum supply of 21 million coins.
                        As a result, Bitcoin follows a clearly defined
                        and predictable monetary issuance schedule.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The reduction of the block reward
                        directly affects supply dynamics and market structure.
                        With each halving, fewer new bitcoins enter circulation,
                        while existing coins remain unchanged.
                        Over time, this creates increasing scarcity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For miners, halving events reduce revenue per block.
                        To remain profitable,
                        efficiency, access to low-cost energy,
                        and modern hardware become increasingly important.
                        Despite declining block rewards,
                        network security is preserved,
                        as mining activity and difficulty
                        automatically adjust.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Technically, halving is triggered by a fixed rule:
                        after every 210,000 blocks,
                        the block reward is automatically reduced by half.
                        With an average block time of approximately ten minutes,
                        this corresponds to roughly four years.
                        The mechanism operates autonomously
                        without any central coordination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Historical overview of block rewards:
                        <br>
                        • 03/01/2009 – 28/11/2012: 50 BTC per block (initial phase)

                        • 28/11/2012 – 09/07/2016: 25 BTC per block (1st halving cycle)
                        <br>
                        • 09/07/2016 – 11/05/2020: 12.5 BTC per block (2nd halving cycle)
                        <br>
                        • 11/05/2020 – 20/04/2024: 6.25 BTC per block (3rd halving cycle)
                        <br>
                        • From 20/04/2024 onward: 3.125 BTC per block (4th halving cycle)
                        <br>

                        In summary, halving ensures that Bitcoin
                        operates under a fixed and non-manipulable monetary policy.
                        The gradual reduction of new supply
                        makes the system predictable over the long term,
                        fundamentally distinguishing Bitcoin
                        from traditional fiat currencies
                        and forming a core pillar

                        A wallet is the digital interface
                        used to store and manage Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
                        Unlike traditional banks,
                        bitcoins are not stored physically,
                        but exist solely as entries on the blockchain.
                        A wallet holds the private keys
                        that grant access to these coins.
                        Whoever controls the private key

                        providing a very high level of security.
                        Paper wallets consist of keys printed on paper
                        and stored completely offline,

                        Wallets operate using public-key cryptography.
                        The public key functions as a receiving address,
                        similar to a bank account number.
                        The private key acts like a password
                        that grants control over the coins.
                        This cryptographic system ensures
                        that transactions are secure and verifiable
                        without requiring a central authority.

                        Backup strategy is another critical consideration.
                        Losing a private key
                        or damaging a wallet
                        results in permanent loss of access to the coins.
                        Secure backups should therefore be stored
                        in multiple locations,
                        ideally in encrypted form.
                        Many wallets also generate a recovery seed —
                        a sequence of words
                        that allows the wallet
                        to be restored at any time.

                        For newcomers, it is essential
                        to understand wallets not merely as storage tools,
                        but as key components of personal security.
                        This includes using strong passwords,
                        enabling two-factor authentication,
                        and keeping software up to date.
                        Wallets provide direct access to bitcoin
                        and are therefore a central element
                        of usage, custody, and security
                        within the Bitcoin network.

                        Bitcoin’s security is based on clearly defined
                        cryptographic mechanisms
                        that make manipulation practically impossible.
                        Central components include cryptographic hash functions
                        such as SHA-256
                        as well as digital signatures.
                        Each block contains a hash
                        derived from its data,
                        acting as a unique fingerprint:
                        even the smallest modification
                        would be immediately detected.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digital signatures ensure
                        that transactions can only be authorized
                        by the holder of the corresponding private key.
                        These signatures can be verified
                        by all network participants
                        without revealing the private key itself.
                        This guarantees authenticity and integrity
                        without relying on centralized trust.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This cryptographic security
                        is reinforced by the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.
                        The computational effort required
                        makes retroactive changes to the blockchain
                        extremely costly and practically infeasible.
                        A successful attack
                        would require overwhelming control
                        over the network’s total hash power.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another critical security factor
                        is decentralization.
                        Thousands of independent nodes
                        store and validate the blockchain in parallel.
                        As a result,
                        the network remains operational
                        even if individual participants fail
                        or are compromised.
                        Security is therefore achieved
                        not through trust in actors,
                        but through verifiable rules
                        and distributed enforcement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This security model
                        can be summarized
                        by a fundamental principle:
                        “Don’t trust, verify.”
                        Trust is replaced
                        by transparent protocol rules,
                        cryptographic proof,
                        and independent verification.
