    <h1 class="subtab-title">The Origins of Bitcoin</h1>

    <div class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-content">

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            The origin of Bitcoin is closely linked to the global economic events of 2007 and 2008.
            During this period, the world economy experienced one of the most severe financial crises in modern history.
            Banks that were previously considered stable faced massive liquidity problems,
            and governments were forced to implement bailout programs to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system.
            These events exposed the vulnerabilities of centralized financial institutions
            and highlighted the risks created when private banks take excessive risks while taxpayers bear the consequences.
        </p>

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            The collapse of major financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers in September 2008 marked a turning point.
            Global financial markets were shaken, and millions of people lost their savings, jobs, or homes.
            Trust in centralized financial institutions reached historic lows.
            At the same time, rapid advancements in internet technology created new opportunities
            to develop digital solutions independent of traditional intermediaries.
        </p>

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            In October 2008, a person or group using the pseudonym <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>
            published the now-famous whitepaper titled
            “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”.
            The paper described a digital payment system without a central authority,
            enabling value to be transferred directly between parties without the need for banks or payment providers.
        </p>

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            The core innovation behind Bitcoin is blockchain technology —
            a decentralized, immutable ledger in which all transactions are recorded chronologically.
            Every participant can verify the data, increasing transparency and preventing fraud.
            Unlike traditional banking systems, Bitcoin transactions are validated through a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.
        </p>

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            Satoshi Nakamoto’s goal was to create a trustless system in which users do not need to rely on any central authority.
            This concept was a direct response to the failures of the traditional financial system,
            particularly government bailouts and uncontrolled monetary expansion.
            People were searching for alternatives that were stable, transparent,
            and independent of political influence.
        </p>

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            In January 2009, the foundation of the Bitcoin network was laid with the creation of the so-called Genesis Block.
            The first 50 bitcoins were generated, although these coins are technically unspendable.
            The Genesis Block contained the now-famous newspaper headline:
            “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”,
            which is widely interpreted as a deliberate commentary on the financial crisis
            and the motivation behind Bitcoin.
            A few days later, the first documented Bitcoin transaction took place,
            when Satoshi Nakamoto sent 10 BTC to developer Hal Finney.
        </p>

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            In its early years, Bitcoin remained largely known among technologists and cypherpunks.
            In 2010, the first real-world purchase was recorded:
            two pizzas bought for 10,000 BTC — a transaction that has since become legendary.
        </p>

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            As attention grew, trading platforms emerged and the number of nodes in the network steadily increased.
            This development strengthened the stability and global reach of Bitcoin.
            Over time, various improvements and forks were proposed to enhance scalability, security, and functionality.
            However, Bitcoin’s core principles — decentralization, transparency,
            and a fixed supply limit of 21 million coins — have remained unchanged.
        </p>

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            The social significance of Bitcoin continued to grow.
            In economically unstable countries, Bitcoin became a hedge against hyperinflation,
            while in technologically advanced regions it evolved into an investment asset.
            Despite these different use cases, the underlying objective remains the same:
            an independent, decentralized monetary system that returns financial control to individuals.
        </p>

        <p class="REVOLUTION_HISTORY-text">
            In summary, the history of Bitcoin demonstrates how technological innovation
            can emerge as a response to economic crises.
            Decentralized systems offer an alternative to centralized structures
            and have inspired millions of people worldwide.
